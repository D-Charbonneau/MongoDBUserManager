# MongoDBUserManager

# Setup:

1: Clone/Download Repo
2: Initialize Node
3: Run MongoDB with the default port. You may need to make a collection called public
4: Run (node server.js or nodemon server.js)
5: Open a broswer and navigate to http://localhost (As 80 is the default http port, you shouldn't need to add a port)
